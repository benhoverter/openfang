//! # openfang-mcp-bridge
//!
//! MCP (Model Context Protocol) bridge for OpenFang Agent OS.
//!
//! ## What this crate is
//!
//! A protocol adapter that exposes OpenFang's tool surface to Claude Code
//! subprocesses (and other MCP clients) over stdio. One MCP server instance
//! per parent agent, scoped to that agent's identity and the capabilities
//! declared in its `agent.toml`.
//!
//! ## What this crate is NOT
//!
//! - It does NOT depend on `openfang-runtime`, `openfang-kernel`, or
//!   `openfang-memory` directly. The bridge consumes a narrow
//!   [`ToolDispatcher`] trait that the runtime exposes; the runtime owns
//!   identity, the kernel owns dispatch, the memory subsystem stays untouched.
//! - It does NOT define OpenFang's tool surface beyond a small built-in slice
//!   (see [`built_in_tools`]). The schemas declared here mirror
//!   `openfang_runtime::tool_runner::builtin_tool_definitions()` for the
//!   four ANAI-30 allowlisted tools — kept in lockstep deliberately.
//!
//! ## Project status
//!
//! ANAI-30 step 3. The bridge now:
//! - Defines the [`ToolDispatcher`] seam trait — the runtime (or, in the real
//!   topology, the daemon-bound IPC client) implements it.
//! - Registers the four-tool ANAI-30 surface (`file_read`, `file_list`,
//!   `agent_list`, `channel_send`) and translates `tools/call` into
//!   [`ToolDispatcher::call`].
//! - Filters its advertised tool list against [`ToolDispatcher::allowed_tools`]
//!   so an agent never sees tools its capabilities don't permit.
//!
//! Identity is bound at construction time. The IPC client implementation
//! lives in `main.rs`. ANAI-31 will replace the in-band-agent-id stub with
//! token-derived identity.
