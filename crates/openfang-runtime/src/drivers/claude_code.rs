//! Claude Code CLI backend driver.
//!
//! Spawns the `claude` CLI (Claude Code) as a subprocess in print mode (`-p`),
//! which is non-interactive and handles its own authentication.
//! This allows users with Claude Code installed to use it as an LLM provider
//! without needing a separate API key.
//!
//! Tracks active subprocess PIDs and enforces message timeouts to prevent
//! hung CLI processes from blocking agents indefinitely.

/// blanket-denies the tool with no specifier. The MCP namespace
/// (`mcp__openfang__*`) lives in a separate pattern space and is untouched —
/// that's the point: replace the native surface with the gated bridge
/// surface.
///
/// Inclusions:
/// - `Bash` — shell execution. `shell_exec` (commit 13b) is the gated
///   replacement.
/// - `Read`/`Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit`/`NotebookEdit` — filesystem mutation.
///   Bridge's `file_read`/`file_write` are the gated replacements.
/// - `WebFetch`/`WebSearch` — outbound network from the model. Bridge's
///   `web_fetch` is the gated replacement.
/// - `Glob`/`Grep` — filesystem read, denied for symmetry: any FS-read path
///   must go through the bridge's sandboxed `file_read`/`file_list`.
/// - `BashOutput`/`KillShell`/`KillBash` — read stdout / kill backgrounded
///   `Bash`. Inert today (Bash is denied) but locked down as defense in
///   depth: if a future CC release introduces a separate path to background
///   shells, these adjuncts must not become live.
/// - `SlashCommand` — invokes CC's skill substrate, a parallel curation
///   surface. OpenFang's skill curation is the canonical path; deny CC's.
/// - `Skill` — the same skill-invocation substrate as `SlashCommand`,
///   reached by name rather than slash. Reconciled with it: the native CC
///   skills behind it (`schedule`, `loop`, `update-config`, `run`) are
///   OpenFang-First violations; OF's `skill_execute` is the canonical path.
/// - `Task` — CC's subagent spawner, a parallel orchestration plane.
///   OpenFang owns orchestration via `agent_spawn`/`agent_send`; denied so
///   a subprocess can't fork an unobserved CC subagent tree.
/// - `AskUserQuestion` — interactive multiple-choice picker. Inert by
///   construction under OF's launch mode (`-p`, stdin nulled, no TTY): it
///   can never reach the user and dead-ends silently. Denied so CC returns
///   an explicit deny `tool_result` instead of a silent black hole the
///   model may confabulate around.
/// - `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree` — creates a git worktree on disk
///   outside the agent workspace, a direct FS-escape primitive. A native
///   workspace-aware worktree tool is on the follow-up backlog; until then,
///   no worktree creation through CC.
/// - `NotebookRead` — symmetry with `NotebookEdit`. Not advertised in the
///   current CC version we target, but pre-denied for forward-compat: if
///   a future CC ships it, the deny is already in place.
/// - `CronCreate`/`CronDelete`/`CronList` — CC-side scheduling control
///   plane (Anthropic-hosted Routines). Per the OpenFang-First Principle,
///   scheduling is owned by OF's cron / orchestrator. No parallel plane.
/// - `ScheduleWakeup` — same class as Cron*: lets CC self-pace dynamic
///   loops outside OF's orchestration. Denied.
/// - `RemoteTrigger` — directly manages Anthropic-hosted scheduled jobs
///   via `claude.ai/v1/code/triggers`. Same OpenFang-First rationale.
/// - `Monitor` — long-running shell streamer. Executes arbitrary shell
///   commands, bypassing `shell_exec`'s `exec_policy` gating. This is
///   `Bash`-with-streaming; denied for the same reason as `Bash`.
/// - `PushNotification` — bypasses OF's channel routing for user-facing
///   notifications. Soft policy gap rather than security; denied to keep
///   comms on the canonical path.
///
/// Deliberately NOT denied: `TodoWrite`, `EnterPlanMode`/`ExitPlanMode`,
/// `TaskOutput`/`TaskStop`, `ToolSearch` — agent-internal control flow /
/// bookkeeping the agent loop depends on, with no escape surface to the
/// host system.
